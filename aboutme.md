If you want to know more about me, scroll down and follow my geospatial journey!

I am particularly interested in Earth Observation, Satellite Remote Sensing, Space Technology, Computer Vision and 
python programming for scientific and humanitarian applications. I promote the use of Free and Open Source Sofware 
for Geospatial (FOSS4G) and I strongly support open geospatial data.

I am a husband, a father, geospatialist ,and a humanitarian.

## Trainings and Conference
<p>I led a training series for the Department of Agriculture Head and Regional offices on the use of Free and Open Source Software for Agriculture DRR (FOSS4AgriDRR) for the Disaster Risk Reduction. Specialized topics on Remote Sensing, GIS Analysis, Geospatial Database, UAV Operation, and Vulanerability Assessment and Mapping were coverd during the the 5 weeks intense training.</p>
