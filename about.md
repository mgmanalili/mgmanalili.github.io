Hello. I am a Michael and I am currently working for UN World Food Programme.
I came from a science background (Forestry) but now I am into Geospatial
Science, Technology and Information Systems.

I am interested in Earth Observation, Remote Sensing, Computer Vision and Python
Programming and I am working towards a self-taught learning for personal 
development and to keep me busy when I have spare time.

I am a husband, a father, and a humanitarian.

say hi to me! michaelandrew.manalili@gmail.com
