This is a tutorial on how to deploy a simple web application using free services from Google. I created a campus map for UPLB
since it does not exist at the moment. You can access it [here](https://project001-215910.appspot.com/?fbclid=IwAR3WkYDRTz8ydS5_PPOHr7BRUstVIvZ5QnKq4XCPsmXIROvCwMGn3YO-qKc) if you want to have a look!
